                  Trigonometry is a branch of geometry that is fundamental to all graphics programming.  It provides useful equations that enable us to figure out distances between points and how curves and circles can be described in Cartesian coordinates. Remember Cartesian coordinates are points described by x and y values. Trigonmetry will also enables you to do things like move shaoes in circular motion or oscillate values smoothly back and forth between two extremes.

                <p>The right angled triangle is one of the most important parts of trigonometry and Pythagoras was a guy who got pretty famous for figuring out a theorem that relates the length of each of its sides. Pythagora figured out that in every right hand triangle, if you square each of the two shortest sides, their sum equals the square of the longest side. <p>

                <p>Right angled triangles are special also because their angles have a specific relationship to the ratio between the length of their sides. This is what sine, cosine and tangent functions describe. Sin cos and tan are known as trigonometric functions and they give us the relationship between the ratio of two of the triangle’s sides and one of the angles of the triangle. You may recall the acronym: SOH-CAH-TOA that helps you remember how sinθ, cosθ and tanθ relate to the ratio of which of the triangle’s sides.   </p>

      <p>This is all pretty great, because is means that with just a couple of pieces of information about a right angled triangle, like knowing two of its side lengths or maybe knowing one of its angle and a side length, you can use Pythagora’s theorem in combination with the sin, cos and tan equations to figure out everything else.</p>

                <p>These triangles are also helpful as they help us to map and understand the x and y coordinates of points along curves and circles. Notice how in the drawing below you can see how any point on a circle will have a relationship to a right angled triangle. This relationship means that a point on a circle can be understood in two ways. Firstly, as we have seen it can be described by Cartesian coordinate which are of course, by x and y co-ordinates, but it can also be described using polar coordinates. Polar coodinates are an angle and a distance from the origin (the radius of the circle). </p>

                <div class="info" id = "Polar Coordinates">
                  <p>
                    Polar coordinates describe a point using an angle and a distance from the origin. It might seem strange, but the angle is measured as shown in the diagram below, where the x axis is 0 degrees and the angle increases as moving counter-clockwise round the origin.

      PICTURE OF POLAR COORDINATES AND THE ORIGIN

      You might be wondering, why would you need to define a point in degrees and a distance, rather than coordinates? Imagine trying to code something like an analog clock. You would want to place each hand using an angle and yet you would need to draw it to the screen by using a line made up of two connecting points. So you would need to be able to translate from polar coordinates to the x-y coordinates of the screen.

      Putting anything on a screen always requires you to describe it in terms of x and y.

                  <p>
                    So how do we convert between polar coordinates and x-y coordinates?</p>
                    <p>
                    The relationship between polar coordinates and x,y coordinates can be calculated using a unit circle. This is a circle that has a radius of 1 unit which is particularly useful as it means the hypotenuse in the right angled triangle is always 1.
